            <h2 id="blondietitle">Blondie</h2>
            <p id="blondiep">Blondie is a half-whippet/half-lab who was rescued by the Humane Society of Cowlitz County, WA. She was ultra-thin after being dumped by her previous family and became untrusting of any humans. After getting some much needed medical attention, Blondie was up for adoption and selected by the McCarty family who showed her what being a family-member should feel like. Blondie is a very healthy 60 pounds and although takes a while to trust people she is a dog who loves to run after her ball, layout in the sun, and eat slices of <span> &#x1f34e </span>. </p>

            <h2 id="laszlotitle">Laszlo</h2>
            <p id="laszlop">Laszlo is an American Black Labrador and is all about being puppy. He was born on Sept 27 2021 in Rochester, WA and was adopted on 24 December 2021. Laszlo has quickly become the energetic member of the family as everything has to be a race. Whether it is one of the human members or his big sister Blondie, he will get your attention and immediately take off like there is no tomorrow. Laszlo's other love is his balls. He will fixate on chasing a ball all day long until he collapses from exhaustion.  If it was up to Laslo, every day would be National <span>&#9918</span> Day! </p>

            <h2 id="advtitle">Adventures Together</h2>
            <p id="bothp">Both Blondie and Laszlo are two dogs that complement each other well. Blondie can have high anxiety one second because of a road trip, and Laszlo knows to stay calm with her. When both want the ball and there is only one, Laszlo lets Blondie have it.  Maybe because she is older and just wants to offer some respect. When treats are to be had each dog sits next to each other and doesn't grab the food unless the food is directly in front of them. They each have their moments but inside both just want love, walks, treats, and living their best life as a <span>&#128021</span>!</p>
